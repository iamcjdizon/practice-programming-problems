In this problem I've noticed that the pattern has the equation: ouput=10-input for every series(loop). In the first loop, the input is 1, then the output is 9, which makes the equation valid. For the second loop, the input is 2, then the output is 8, which makes the equation valid. So I've used that pattern.
